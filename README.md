### David's suggestions

- for fixed `R0`, draw curves with varying `delta` so that we can see the effect of `delta`

- if you can't get peak prevalence and final size analytically, you can certainly do it numerically
    - plot peak prevalence as a function of `delta` for fixed `R0` with `R0` varying in different panels
    - similarly plot final size (`Q(t)` for `t` large enough that we are close to the final size; e.g., stop if `I<1e-6`) as a function of `delta` for fixed `R0` with `R0` varying in different panels
