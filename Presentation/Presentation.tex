\frametitle{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{10pt}
\item What are the historical examples?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{10pt}
\item Variolation with smallpox
\begin{itemize}
\pause\item use scabs from infected person to infect someone else via skin
\pause\item variolation led to death less often than natural infection.
\end{itemize}
\pause\item Pox parties
\begin{itemize}
\pause\item increase contact rate to cause more natural infections
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Now illegal or uncommon -- why do we care?
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{10pt}
\pause\item In history, the mechanisms and benefits of intentional infection  on a population level was not quite understood.
\pause\item New application to disease control: transmissible vaccines
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Method}
Standard SIR model:
\pause
\begin{equation}\label{1}
\begin{split}
\dbyd{S}{t}&=\mu- \beta SI-\mu S \,,\\
\dbyd{I}{t}&=\beta SI-\gamma I -\mu I\,,\\
\dbyd{R}{t}&=\gamma I-\mu R\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $S$, $I$ and $R$ represent susceptible, infected and recovered.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{10pt}
\item $\mu$ is birth/death rate  \qquad(total population size $N$ is constant)
\item $\beta$ is transmission rate
\item $\gamma$ is recovery rate
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Method}
{\bfseries Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep10pt
\item No difference between intentionally infected and naturally infected individuals.
\item No disease induced mortality \qquad (in first version of model)
%%\item Birth and natural death rate are the same, the total population remains constant.
\item Latent period (time from infection to becoming infectious) is short enough to be ignored.
\item All susceptible individuals are equally likely to be infected, and all infected individuals are equally infectious.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Method}
With intentional infection of newborns, 
\begin{equation}\label{2}
\begin{split}
\dbyd{S}{t}&=\mu(1-p)- \beta SI-\mu S \,,\\
\dbyd{I}{t}&=\beta SI+\mu p-\gamma I -\mu I\,,\\
\dbyd{R}{t}&=\gamma I-\mu R\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where 
$$
p  = \text{proportion of newborns intentionally infected}
$$
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
Non-dimensionalize the above system by scaling time, by
\begin{equation}
\tau=(\gamma+\mu)t \,,
\end{equation}
so time unit is ``mean time infected''.

\pause
Dimensionless system is:
\begin{subequations}\label{3}
\begin{align}
\dbyd{S}{\tau}&=\epsilon(1-p)- \R_0  SI-\epsilon S \,,\\
\dbyd{I}{\tau}&=\R_0 SI+\epsilon p-I \,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where 
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\epsilon&=\frac{\mu}{\gamma+\mu} \qquad\text{(infectious period as
          proportion of lifetime)}\,,\\
\R_0&=\frac{\beta}{\gamma+\mu} \qquad\text{(basic reproduction number)}\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Equilibria}
Solving equations above to find equilibria, we obtain only one solution,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\hat{S} &=\frac{1}{\R_0}-\frac{2p}{(\R_0 -1)+ \sqrt{(\R_0-1)^2+4\R_0 p}}\,, \label{Shat1}\\
\hat{I} &= \frac{\epsilon(\R_0 -1)+ \epsilon \sqrt{(\R_0-1)^2+4\R_0
    p}}{2\R_0}\,.\label{Ihat1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{itemize}
\pause\item $\hat{I}\neq 0$ for all $p$ between 0 and 1. 
\pause\item This equilibrium is an {\bfseries Endemic Equilibrium (EE)}.
\pause\item Without intentional infection ($p=0$) EE reduces to
\begin{equation}
\hat{S} = \frac{1}{\R_0} \,,\qquad 
\hat{I} = \epsilon\Big(1-\frac{1}{\R_0}\Big) \,.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Jacobian Matrix,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{J} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \ -\R_0 I-\epsilon       & -\R_0 S \\
    \ \R_0 I       & \R_0 S-1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \,.
\end{equation}

\frametitle{What else do we need?}
\pause
\begin{itemize}\itemsep10pt
\item How can we compare the results of this model to others and
  determine advantages or disadvantages of intentional infection?
\pause
\item Define ``advantage'' as ``fewer deaths''.
\pause
\item If intentionally infected cases have the same case fatality proportion (CFP) as naturally infected cases, then it will result in \emph{more} deaths.
\begin{itemize}
\item But variolation had lower CFP
\pause $\implies$ revise model to include different CFP for
intentional infections.
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item We need to divide $I$ into two separate infective classes. $V$ for intentionally infected class, $I$ for naturally infected class.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Model with disease induced mortality rate}

Therefore, our model becomes,
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:base_ODE}
\begin{align}
\dbyd{S}{\tau}&=\epsilon(1-p)- \R_0 S(V+I)-\epsilon S\,, \label{eq:S_by_tau}\\
\dbyd{V}{\tau}&=\R_0 SV+\epsilon p-V\,, \label{eq:V_by_tau}\\
\dbyd{I}{\tau}&=\R_0 SI-I\,, \label{eq:I_by_tau}\\
\dbyd{M}{\tau}&=\pmV(1-\epsilon) V+\pmI(1-\epsilon) I\,,\\
\dbyd{R}{\tau}&=(1-\pmV)(1-\epsilon) V+(1-\pmI)(1-\epsilon) I-\epsilon R\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\pmV$ and $\pmI$ represent the case fatality proportion (CFP)
for intentionally infected and naturally infected cases, respectively.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Equilibria}

If $p\neq 0$, the only equilibrium is,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\hat{S}&= \frac{1}{\R_0}-\frac{2p}{(\R_0 -1)+ \sqrt{(\R_0-1)^2+4\R_0
         p}}\,, \label{eq:Shat}\\
\hat{V}&= \frac{\epsilon(\R_0 -1)+ \epsilon \sqrt{(\R_0-1)^2+4\R_0 p}}{2\R_0}\,, \label{eq:Vhat}\\
\hat{I}&=0\,. \label{eq:Ihat}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{itemize}
\item No naturally infected cases at endemic equilibrium (EE).
\begin{itemize}
\item Helpful for disease eradication.
